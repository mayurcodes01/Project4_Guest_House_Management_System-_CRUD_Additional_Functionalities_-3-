# Guest House Management System (Python CLI Project)

This is a simple Guest House Management System built in Python using the Command Line Interface (CLI). It allows you to manage room bookings for a guest house using basic Python data structures and operations.

## Features

- View All Bookings: Display all current bookings.
- Update Booking: Modify existing booking information.
- Delete Booking: Cancel and remove a room booking.
- Check Room Availability: View current status of all rooms.

| Single AC         | 1500                |
| Double Non-AC     | 1800                |
| Double AC         | 2500                |
